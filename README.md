# wp-child-theme

A child theme in WordPress is a secondary theme that inherits the functionality and styling of a parent theme while allowing you to make customizations and modifications without altering the parent theme directly. It acts as an overlay or extension to the parent theme, allowing you to tailor your WordPress website's appearance and functionality to your specific needs.
